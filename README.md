Democratizing Quantitative Finance: A Comparative Analysis of Stock Forecasting Pipelines Generated by Large Language Models.

Quantitative Stock Forecasting: A Comparative Research Project
This repository documents a systematic, end-to-end research project to develop and evaluate quantitative models for next-day (t+1) stock price forecasting. The primary objective was to build a pipeline capable of outperforming a strong baseline set by a generalist AutoML model.

- **Primary Research Question:** To what extent can publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) generate effective and practical end-to-end stock forecasting pipelines that outperform established automated machine learning baselines?
- **Secondary Research Questions:**
    1. How do the generated pipelines from different LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) compare in terms of predictive **accuracy** (RMSE, MAE, Directional Accuracy)?
    2. What are the differences in the **complexity** of the generated pipelines (feature count, model architecture, training time)?
    3. How do the pipelines compare in terms of **practicality** for a non-expert user (lines of code, external dependencies, ease of implementation)?
    4. What is the statistical **precision** (variance in performance) of each pipeline when applied across a diverse sample of global stocks and indices?

The research was conducted in two distinct tracks, each testing a different core hypothesis
