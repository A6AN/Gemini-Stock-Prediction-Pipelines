Democratizing Quantitative Finance: A Comparative Analysis of Stock Forecasting Pipelines Generated by Large Language Models.

Quantitative Stock Forecasting: A Comparative Research Project
This repository documents a systematic, end-to-end research project to develop and evaluate quantitative models for next-day (t+1) stock price forecasting. The primary objective was to build a pipeline capable of outperforming a strong baseline set by a generalist AutoML model.

The research was conducted in two distinct tracks, each testing a different core hypothesis:

Pipeline 1: A feature-driven approach using a powerful gradient boosting model.

Pipeline 2: A deep learning approach using state-of-the-art sequential models.

All experiments were managed using DVC for reproducibility and MLflow for tracking, ensuring a professional and rigorous MLOps workflow.

The Challenge: The AutoML Baseline
The initial benchmark was established by running the target dataset through AutoGluon. Any successful pipeline must outperform the following metrics:

Metric

AutoGluon Baseline

RMSE

MAE

1.99

Directional Accuracy

Pipeline 1: The Enhanced Gradient Boosting Powerhouse
This pipeline was built on the hypothesis that superior, handcrafted feature engineering and systematic model tuning could find a stronger signal than a generalist AutoML solution.

Research & Development Summary
The pipeline evolved through a rigorous, iterative process. The key breakthroughs are summarized below:

SUCCESS. Runtime drastically improved. The model now beat the directional accuracy baseline.

SUCCESS. Directional accuracy improved, confirming that RFE created a more robust model.

V5

BREAKTHROUGH. This was the most successful run, achieving peak directional accuracy. This became the champion model.

Conclusion for Pipeline 1
The hypothesis was validated. The V5 architecture proved that a carefully crafted, feature-rich tabular model is exceptionally effective for this forecasting problem. It is fast, robust, and delivers a significant and tradable edge in predicting market direction.

Pipeline 2: The Sequential Deep Learning Specialist
This pipeline was developed to test an alternative hypothesis: that deep learning models designed for sequences (LSTMs, GRUs, etc.) could find complex temporal patterns that the tabular model from Pipeline 1 could not.

Research & Development Summary
Multiple state-of-the-art architectures were implemented and tested using the same rigorous walk-forward validation framework.

Conclusion for Pipeline 2
The hypothesis was invalidated. The sequential deep learning approach, despite its theoretical advantages, proved to be a suboptimal strategy for this specific dataset. The models were highly sensitive to noise, computationally expensive, and ultimately unable to match the directional accuracy of the simpler, feature-driven approach from Pipeline 1.
